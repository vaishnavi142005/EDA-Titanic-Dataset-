# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Titanic dataset. The objective is to uncover insights and patterns in the data using various statistical and visualization techniques.

## 📌 Objective

To understand the Titanic dataset using summary statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis to make feature-level observations.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Matplotlib 📈
- Seaborn 🎨
- Plotly (optional, for interactive visuals)

## 🔍 EDA Steps

1. Generated summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
2. Visualized numeric features using histograms and boxplots
3. Analyzed feature relationships using correlation matrix and pairplots
4. Identified trends, outliers, and anomalies
5. Made feature-level inferences based on visual insights

## ✨ Key Insights

- Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
- 1st class passengers had better survival chances than lower classes.
- High fare seemed to correlate with higher survival rates.
- Age and fare showed some outliers and interesting patterns.

## 📁 Files

- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb`: Main notebook with all the EDA code and visuals
